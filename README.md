<h2>Obtaining Access to Ascent for Training Events</h2>

Please follow the steps below to request access to Ascent for OLCF training events.

<h3>Step 1: Fill out and submit an <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/for-users/documents-forms/olcf-account-application"><b>OLCF Account Application Form</b></a></h3>
Enter the requested information into the form. For "Project Information", enter the following:

For "Account Information", enter the following:

<h3>Step 2: Set Your XCAMS/UCAMS Password</h3>
Once approved, if you are a new user, your account will be created and an email will be sent asking you to set up a password. If you already had an XCAMS/UCAMS account, you will not be sent the email asking you to setup a new password (simply use your existing credentials or visit <a href="https://xcams.ornl.gov/xcams/">https://xcams.ornl.gov/xcams/</a> if you forgot). Once passwords are known, users can log in to Ascent using their XCAMS/UCAMS username and password (see the next section)

<h3>Logging In to Ascent</h3>
To log in to Ascent, please use your XCAMS/UCAMS username and password:

```
$ ssh USERNAME@login1.ascent.olcf.ornl.gov
```

> Note: You do not need to use an RSA token to log in to Ascent. Please use your XCAMS/UCAMS username and password (which is different from the username and PIN + RSA token code used to log in to other OLCF systems such as Summit).

Note: It will take ~5 minutes for your directories to be created, so if your account was just created and you log in and you do not have a home directory, this is likely the reason.
